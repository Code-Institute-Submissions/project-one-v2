# MILESTONE PROJECT ONE

This is the first milsestone project on the Full Stack Web Developer course by Code Institute, utilising HTML and CSS to build a static front-end site to present skills learned to date.

Working as a Quantity Surveyor (QS) in the construction industry, summarising and presenting data in a concise and visual manner is a frequent requirement.  This project is the first step in an endeavour and exploration to make the accessibility of this data easier and instant for the recipients.

This project will summarise and compare a selection of projects from Wembley Park, putting at the fingertips key information that non-QS stakeholders can seek to ascertain without reverting to the QS or other consultants.  The information may be presented to non-project stakeholders, which will give a snapshot of data that they may compare against other projects.

## Steps taken in development

**1. Set up pages file structure required, including assets / css / image**

* 'index.html' will remain as main page, ie 'Overview'

    1. Header - to include logos and naviagation bar
    2. Section - to include main page content (to be divided by Bootrap into information 'zones')
    3. Footer - Concept on what this is to include to be developed at later date  

**3. Header - Logo banner**

  * Utilised two logos as header banner in a horizontal line

  * Layout for small screens - utilised Bootstrap Dropdown, hidden for MD+ screens
    *  Adjusted default formatting to match brand for both large and small screens of Naviation Bar
  * Integrated **hover** over the nav links on the large screen layout to show image of the project
    * Utilised animation to slide-down opaque version of an image representing the project
    *  *Challenge to locate image directly below menu name, but overcame.*
    *  *Would prefer the image to respond to screen size but found this difficult in conjunction with @keyframes*
  * Future improvements?
    *  *May consider opting for Bootstrap Navbar in future, as this would accommodate screen size changes more easily, but decided to leave for this project in order that **hover** would work on the large screens.*

**5. Main Section - Overview and Grapth**

  * Container split into two sections, wrap on XS and S screens to maintain equal / central components
  * Overview to
